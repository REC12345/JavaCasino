My goal for this project is to improve my problem solving skills and familiarity with java while coding a fun game.  Please let me know of any improvements I can make to my code.

Important Technical Notes(for me, myself, and I):
- Remember to press 'run Java' and NOT 'run Code' in VS Code.  For some reason 'run code' won't accept user input.

Notes about the Games:
- BlackJack: Blackjack is mostly functional and is being tested.  New features and functionalities will be added soon.

- Craps: No functionality yet.

- Roulette: No functionality yet.
 
- Slots: No functionality yet.
