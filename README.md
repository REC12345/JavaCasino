My goal for this project is to improve my problem solving skills and familiarity with java while coding a fun and intricate game.  Please let me know of any improvements I can make to my code.

Notes about the Games:
- BlackJack: Blackjack is mostly functional and is being tested.  New features and functionalities will be added soon.
- War: Not yet functional.
