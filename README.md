My goal for this project is to improve my problem solving skills and familiarity with java while coding a fun game.  Please let me know of any improvements I can make to my code.

Important Technical Notes:
- Remember to press 'run Java' and NOT 'run Code' in VS Code.  For some reason 'run code' won't accept user input.
